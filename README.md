## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

I have learned to use clamp(..vw..) to set the font-size, line-height and the size of the avatar image depending on the width of the viewport. I found that very interesting.
I was a bit confused about the fact that the focus state for interactive elements should be set in addition to the hover state. I only know the focus state for the keyboard tab control for input fields. As there are no input fields in this project, I have omitted the focus state.

### Continued development

For now, I would like to continue to concentrate on the possibilities for creating responsive pages. But I'm also looking forward to starting with JavaScript soon.
